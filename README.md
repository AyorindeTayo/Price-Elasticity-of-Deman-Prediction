Price elasticity of demand measures the relative percentage change in Quantity

Price elasticity of demand measures the realtive percentage change in Quantity of a good and services in relative to percentage change in price of the goods and services.
Price elasticities of demand are always negative since price and quantity demanded always move in opposite directions (on the demand curve). By convention, we always talk about elasticities as positive numbers. Mathematically, we take the absolute value of the result.
An elastic demand is one in which the change in quantity demanded due to a change in price is large. An inelastic demand is one in which the change in quantity demanded due to a change in price is small
